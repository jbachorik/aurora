GreaseMonkey scripts to make gatekeeping easier

The script adds a new clickable link "Generate Report" in the upper left corner of the Aurora Chessboard. 
Once clicked it will pre-generate the daily report for the currently selected date.

The functionality depends on the Auroras layout. No guarantees provided.
